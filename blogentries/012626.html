                    Welcome to the new home of Hybrid Habits! This is where I'll be sharing all my projects, experiments, and thoughts — professional, personal, or just random bits of life. I wanted a space that I could fully customize, truly mine, and where everything lives in one place. This is it.

                    A few quick notes: the site is very much a work in progress, and comments aren't available yet — I'll figure out a proper backend eventually.

                    It's been about seven months since my last post on WordPress. Life since then has mostly been uni and work, with the highlight being a long-awaited trip to the UK. Not much else of note, but it feels good to get back to writing here in a space that's completely mine.

                    Hybrid Habits isn't just a portfolio — it's a home for reflection, experiments, and whatever I feel like sharing. Some posts will be quick updates; others might dive deeper into projects or personal thoughts. Thanks for stopping by, and I'm excited to see where this new chapter goes!
