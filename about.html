            <div class="welcome-box">
                <p>I'm passionate about building things, sharing knowledge, and exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. The Hybrid Habits is where I bring it all together – a space dedicated to exploring the hybrid nature of modern creativity and personal growth.</p>
                
                <p>With a focus on learning and experimentation, I'm constantly exploring new ideas, tools, and methodologies. Whether it's through code, design, writing, or community engagement, I believe in the power of creating meaningful work and connecting with others who share similar passions.</p>
                
                <p>This website serves as a hub for all my projects, links, and connections. Think of it as a digital "who am I" page – a snapshot of my journey, my interests, and the various platforms where I share my work.</p>
